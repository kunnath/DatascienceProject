## Scan product component information from images

 Utilize computer vision techniques to extract text data from images of product components. This process involves capturing frames from a camera feed, converting them to text using optical character recognition (OCR) with pytesseract, and storing the extracted information in text and CSV files. This functionality allows for automated data extraction and analysis from product images.
